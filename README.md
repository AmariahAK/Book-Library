# Book Search and Recommendation App

Welcome to the Book Search and Recommendation App! This application is a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and manage their favorite books.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a frontend web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that integrates with a public API (Google Books API) to fetch and display book information. The app also implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using json-server for data persistence of user favorite books.

### Learning Goals

- **Design and Architect Features**: Design a user-friendly interface for searching and managing books.
- **Communicate and Collaborate**: Work on the project independently while leveraging resources and collaborating with instructors and peers.
- **Integrate JavaScript and API**: Use asynchronous JavaScript to communicate with the Google Books API and json-server for data management.
- **Debugging in Small-to-Medium Projects**: Identify and fix issues encountered during development.
- **Build and Iterate on MVP**: Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and iterate based on feedback and additional features.

## Features

- **Book Search**: Enter keywords to search for books using the Google Books API.
- **Search Results**: Display book search results with book covers, titles, authors, and descriptions.
- **Add to Favorites**: Add books to a favorites list and store them using json-server for data persistence.
- **View and Manage Favorites**: View the list of favorite books, remove books from favorites, and perform CRUD operations.

## Additional Considerations

### Persistence with json-server:

The app uses json-server to store and manage user favorite books with CRUD operations.

### Advanced Features (Stretch Goals):

- Implement pagination or filtering for search results to enhance user experience.
- Explore additional API features for personalized book recommendations based on user preferences.
